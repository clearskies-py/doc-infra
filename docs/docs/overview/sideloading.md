Every aspect of clearskies is meant to be modified and this is controlled by replacing classes via configuration. Do you want to connect to an RDS via IAM auth instead of static credentials? Do you want some of your models to store data in memory, some to fetch/save data to an external API, and some to connect via IAM auth to an RDS in a private subnet by using an SSM tunnel through a bastion? No problem. Define your behavior once and re-use it everywhere without issue.
