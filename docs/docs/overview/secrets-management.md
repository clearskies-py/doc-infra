# Secrets Management

clearskies integrates tightly with your secret management system to bring secrets back _into_ the application. Most applications work by pulling secrets from the environment when they launch.  You can do that with clearskies if you want, but clearskies is designed to fetch secrets directly from your secret manager as needed.  This allows it to work smoothly with dynamic credentials and can automate the process of updating the application if you rotate your credentials.  Other than the direct benefits of simplifying credential management, this also dramatically simplifies the process of application bootstrapping.  Often, running an application locally for the first time starts with a painful process of collecting the necessary credentials and correctly configuring the application environment.  With clearskies, you just need to ensure that the application has permission to access your secret manager, and then it will bootstrap itself.
